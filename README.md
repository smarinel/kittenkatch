Kitten Katch 

An Atari 2600 (NTSC) game by Seth Marinello
2021

Kittens on the loose! Your young kittens have all escaped their box and you must catch them before the cause a mess. Each round they will scurry around the yard, trying to avoid capture. In later stages one of them will release a ball of yard that will bounce around and tangle you up if it hits you!


How it works:

* Move around using the Joystick.
* Press Fire to grab a kitten when you catch up. 
* Carry each kitten to the box to drop them off.
* You must deposit each loose kitten back in the box before the timer runs out in order to clear the stage. 
* Each round will be a bit harder than the last. See how far you can go!


Scoring: 

* For each kitten you return to the box you earn 15 points.
* At the end of each round you earn additional points for the time remaining. 
* Getting hit by the ball of yarn doesnâ€™t just cost you time, but also costs you a point. 
* After surviving 9 rounds of Kitten Katch a bonus 10 points will be applied for each kitten you rescue.

Kittens:
